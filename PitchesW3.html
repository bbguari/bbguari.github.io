	<h1>ben guarino's pitches for final project</h1> 
<p> 
<h2>Pitch 1: Student debt versus college donations
</h2>
How does college debt by graduate stack up against alumni donations? What kind of impact do these donations make? My project would compare debt and donation by school to see if a trend exists between the two. To make my comparison, I'll search databases like this one:
<a href="http://projectonstudentdebt.org/state_by_state-data.php">student debt by college/university</a>
</p>

<h2>Pitch 2 (better pitch!): Spread of HIV throughout the US</h2> 
To document the spread of HIV through the US over time, I would create a series of maps showing the number of HIV-positive individuals per capita per county. Using <a href= "http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/library/reports/surveillance/2011/surveillance_Report_vol_23.html#cover">data</a>, <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/library/reports/surveillance/2010/surveillance_Report_vol_22.html#cover">etc</a> obtained from the CDC, I could show how the prevalence of this disease changes year to year. By referencing medical advancements made each year, the maps could demonstrate the impact of new medicine on the spread of HIV.
